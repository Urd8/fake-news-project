# fake-news-project
Student Project for a STI

Throughout this project, we have created a fake news detector prototype. With the capability of identifying and debunking news that was spreaded falsely. Our main purpose of creating such a prototype, is to prevent the chaos and disruption caused by the spread of false news, especially false facts which are written to promote a political agenda or a set of ideas.

Our systems provides functions such as:

A search module in which list out local and credible new sources articles according to what user wishes to search.

A web scraping function which acts as a filter that scrapes only the paragraph element of a webpage. 

A grading function which calculates the percentage match from user’s input with an article.

Ben function’s explanation

A google chrome extension that uses an AI to filter fake news.

Lastly, a feedback form where users can provide useful critiques that help to further better our services.
